            <strong>Runner up - RPA Competition</strong>: I created an RPA solution that automated an 100+ hour recurring process which entailed downloading pages of reports from an ERP, combining the extracted reports into one CSV file, and uploading the CSV file into a PwC Proprietary tool in order to determine a companies most frequent travelers.

            <strong>Deloitte Case Competition Winner</strong>: Participated in Deloitte's annual consulting case competition where our team placed 2nd amonth 16 others.
            <br>
            <strong>Cal Poly Marketing Competition Winner</strong>: My team won Cal Poly's marketing competition where throughout the quarter, we thoroughly research an idea we have through marketing techniques (e.g., SWOT, competitor analysis). Our team created a hypothetical product - "Smart Blanket" - which was targetted for hospitals where the blankets had technology to show doctors the in patients body temperature, movement, etc. With this information, doctors could take the necassary action based on unanticipated symptoms. This would make nurses and doctors lives easier as they don't have to check in on patients frequently, and improve patients experience at hospitals. 
            
            We pitched our idea, along with our reasearch to a board of judges (Shark Tank style) and were awarded the most innovative idea.
